       <p>Modern-day Romania is riddled with racism and willful ignorance. Despite the time that has passed since the enslavement of their people, the Romani population still faces deeply negative perceptions from the public, including from employers and law enforcement.
The Pro Democrația association in Romania conducted a survey where they found that “94% of those questioned believe that Roma people who have committed crimes abroad should have their Romanian citizenship revoked". In another survey, it was revealed that “68% of Romanians think that Roma people commit most crimes, 46% think that they are thieves, while 43% lazy and dirty, and 36% believe that the Roma community might become a threat to Romania.
In another survey made in 2013 by IRES, 57% respondents stated that they generally don't trust people of Roma ancestry and only 17% said to have a Roma friend. Still, 57% said that this ethnic group is not discriminated against in Romania, 59% claimed that the Roma should not receive help from the state, and that Roma people are poor because they don't like to work (72%) and that most of them are thugs (61%). IRES published in 2020 a survey which revealed that 72% of Romanians don't trust Roma people and have a negative opinion about them” (Wikipedia). These opinions are also exhibited in violence against Roma people, as their population is consistently a target of hate crimes across the country.

In addition to a negative perception, there is a lack of awareness about Romani history and the story behind their oppression. In particular, most Romanian school textbooks either barely mention Romani history or omit it entirely. This lack of education leads many Romanians to grow up believing that Romani people are responsible for their own family’s poverty or history of crime, and in fact many Romani people don’t even know that their ancestors used to be enslaved.
