       <p>Roma, or Romani, people are an ethnic minority across Eastern Europe with ancestry originating from South Asia. Romania in particular has a dark history of slavery and institutionalized racism regarding its Romani population, with repercussions existing to this day such as violence and hate crimes, generational poverty and illiteracy, and general anti-Roma sentiment among Romaniaâ€™s citizens. Not only is this in itself a major issue, but what is lacking first and foremost in the country is an awareness of the history of Roma people and an official acknowledgement of the oppression they are continuously subjected to. </p>
