       <p>Roma people began to emigrate from South Asia into the Balkans, particularly mostly the Punjab region of northern India, starting in approximately 1350. The exact reason for their migration is not entirely known to historians, but it is assumed that it was to escape civil unrest and instability. They were then forcibly enslaved by the native Europeans. From this period until the eventual emancipation of slavery in the 19th century, the Romanian economy was highly dependent on the forced labor of the Romani slaves. After enslavement, Romani people had little economic prospects, as racial discrimination in the workplace and social spheres was very prevelant, and so many became homeless and were left in extreme poverty. Even though their legal status was improved, established institutions did not see them as equal citizens to the white Romanians. Even among academics and scholars, anti-Roma sentiment was extremely normalized to the point that it was a common belief that Romani peoples should be sterilized to protect Romania’s “ethnic purity”. In 1942, a series of forced deportations took place in the name of an ethnic cleanse, as the Romani existence in Romania was viewed as a “problem”. To this day, the repercussions of their oppression are maintained. Roma people in Romania continue to be disproportionately imprisoned, earn significantly less in wages than white Romanians, and have staggering rates of illiteracy.
